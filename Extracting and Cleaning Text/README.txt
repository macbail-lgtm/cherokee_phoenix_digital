Project: Cherokee Phoenix (March 1832) OCR

Overview:

For this project, I turned four scanned pages of the Cherokee Phoenix & Indians’ Advocate (March 1832) into text files. Pages 1–3 are lightly cleaned, meaning I only fixed the obvious OCR mistakes, and Page 4 is deeply cleaned, meaning I corrected everything and made it readable.

Tools Used:

ABBYY FineReader PDF – for OCR conversion; was anecessary backup when Acrobat failed me!

TextEdit / VS Code – for manual cleanup

ChatGPT – asked questions throughout the process  


Process:

I tried using Adobe Acrobat at first, but it couldn’t handle the scans at all because the text was way too blurry and uneven. I ended up switching to ABBYY FineReader free trial, which worked a lot better but was still a pretty frustrating process. The software kept misreading letters, skipping lines, and mixing up the columns. I guess this is what you want us to see thought (that digitizing is complex and a long process).

After running the OCR, I saved each page as a .txt file and cleaned them up.

Pages 1–3: light clean (some errors left in)

Page 4: deep clean (fully corrected and formatted)


Accuracy & Issues:

OCR accuracy was quite low on the first pages due to poor print quality, column layout, and the Cherokee syllabury. Adobe Acrobat failed miserably on these pages; ABBYY handled them better but still required a major amount of hand-fixing. Decorative graphics, lines and headers were ignored.

Reflection: 

OCR didn't always capture text well, especially on pages that were faded or had text printed in more than one column.  "Light cleaning" shows what mass-digitization is like most of the time: it's searchable but not always too accurate.  The "deep clean" shows how much work goes into making historical texts usable, which is related to the point point that digitization often relies on editorial work that isn't always credited.  It takes time, care, and compensation for that work to make usable text.
