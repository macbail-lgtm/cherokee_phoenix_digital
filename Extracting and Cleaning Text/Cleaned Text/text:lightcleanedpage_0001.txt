made on the subject, in the follow-
ing terms:—“It is ordered by the
Court that the Clerk of the Court to
which any writ of error shall be di-
rected, may make return of the same
by transmitting a true copy of the re-
cord, and of all proceedings in the
same, under his hand and the seal of
the Court.”

This has been done. But the sig-
nature of the Judge has not been add-
ed to that of the Clerk. The law
does not require it. The rule does
not require it.

In the case of Martin vs. Hunt-
er’s* lessee, an exception was taken
to the return of the refusal of the
State Court to enter a prior judgment
of reversal by this Court, because it
was not made by the judge of the
State Court to which the writ was
directed; but the exception was over-
ruled, and the return was deemed
sufficient. In Duel vs. Van Ness, f
also a writ of error to a State Court,
the record was authenticated in the
same manner.

THE CHEROKEE CASE.

OPINION
by the Supreme Court, delivered by
Mr. Chief justice Marshall, Jana-
ary Term, 1832.

SAMUEL A. WORCESTER,
VS
THE STATE OF GEORGIA.

This cause in every point of view
in which it can be placed is of the
deepest interest.

The defendant is a State, a mem-
ber of the Union, which has exercised
the powers of government over a Peo-
ple who deny its jurisdiction, and are
under the protection of the United
States. The plaintiff is a citizen of the
State of Vermont, condemned to hard
labor for four years in the penitentiary
of Georgia, under colour of an
act which he alleges to be repugnant
to the constitution, and laws, and
treaties, of the United States.

The legislative power of a State,
the controlling power of the constitu-
tion and laws of the United States,
the rights, if they have any, the po-
litical existence of a once numerous
and powerful People, the personal
liberty of a citizen, are all involved
in the subject now to be considered.

It behooves this Court, in every case,
more especially in this, to examine in-
to its jurisdiction with scrutinizing
eyes, before it proceeds to the exer-
cise of a power which is controverted.

The first step in the performance
of this duty is the inquiry whether
the record is properly before the
Court.

It is certified by the Clerk of the
Court which pronounced the judg-
ment of condemnation under which
the plaintiff in error is imprisoned,
and is also authenticated by the seal
of the Court. It is returned with,
and annexed to a writ of error issued
in regular form, the citation being
signed by one of the Associate Jus-
tices of the Supreme Court, and serv-
ed on the Governor and Attorney-
General of the State more than thir-
ty days before the commencement of
the term to which the writ of error
was returnable.

The judicial act,* so far as it pre-
scribes the mode of proceeding, ap-
pears to have been literally pur-
sued. In February, 1797, a rule f was
made on this subject, in the follow-
ing words…

But it has been truly said by the
bar, that, in regard to this process,
the law makes no distinction between
a criminal and civil case. The same
return is required in both. If the sanc-
tion of the Court could be necessary
for the establishment of this position,
it has been silently given.

McCulloh vs. the State of Mary-
land. J was a qui tam action, brought
to recover a penalty, and the record
was authenticated by the seal of the
Court and the signature of the Clerk,
without that of a Judge. Brown et
al. vs. the State of Maryland, was an
indictment for a fine and forfeiture.
The record in this case, too, was au-
thenticated by the seal of the Court
and the certificate of the Clerk. The
practice is both ways.

The record, then, according to the
Judiciary act, and the rule and prac-
tice of the Court, is regularly before
us. The more important inquiry is,
does it exhibit a case cognizable by
this tribunal?

The indictment charges the plain-
tiff in error and others, being white
persons, with the offence of “residing
within the limits of the Cherokee na-
tion without a licence,” and “without
having taken the oath to support and
defend the Constitution and laws of
the State of Georgia.”

The defendant in the State Court
appeared in proper person, and filed
the following plea:

“And the said Samuel A. Worces-
ter, in his own proper person, comes
and says, that this court ought not to
take further cognizance of the action
and prosecution aforesaid, because…
