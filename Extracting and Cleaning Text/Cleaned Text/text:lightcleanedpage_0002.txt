Thick may be true, as Pesp%c('s“'th^

spects the regulation of all affairs con-
nected with their trade, bat cannot
be true, as respects the management
of all their affairs. The most impor-

lands, and security against intruders

could have considered themselves as
surrendering to* the United States the
right to dictate their future cessions,
