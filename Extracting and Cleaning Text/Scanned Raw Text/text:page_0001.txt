THE CHEROKEE CASE.
OPINION
ty the Supreme Court, delivered by
Mr. Chief justice Marshall, Jana
ary Term,. 1832.
SAMUEL A. WORCESTER,
VS
THE STATE OF GEORGIA.
This cause in every point of view
.in which it can be placed is of the
..deepest interest.
The defendant is a St a . e, a mem-
ber of the Union, which has exercised
.the powers of government over a Peo-
ple who deny its jurisdiction, and are
under the protection eff the United
The plaintiff is.a citizen of the
State of Vermont, condemned to hard
labor for four years in the penitentia-
rv of Georgia, under colour of an
act which he alleges to be repugnant
.to. the constitution, and laws, and
treaties, of the United States.
The legislative power of a State,
the,controlling power of the constitu-
tion and laws of thft United States,
dh'e rights, if they have any, the po-
litical existence of a once numerous
and powerful People, the personal
liberty of a citizen, are all involved
tn the subject now to be consider-
ed.
it Helioove.s this Court, in every case,
more especially in this, to examine in-
to its jurisdiction with scrutinizing
eyes, before it proceeds to the exer-
cise of a power which is controvert-
The first step in the performance

the record is properly before the
It is certified by the Clerk of the
Court which pronounced the judg-
ment of condemnation under which
the plaintiff in error is imprisoned,
and is also authenticated by the seal
of the Court. It is returned with,
and annexed to a writ of error issued
in regular form, the citation being
signed by one of the Associate Jus-
tices of the Supreme Court, and serv-
ed on the Governor and Attorney-
General of the State more than thir-
ty days before the commencement of
the term to which the writ of error
tva's returnable.
The judicial act,* so far as it pre-
scribes the mode of proceeding, ap-
pears to have been literally pur-
in February, 1797, a rulef- was
But it has been truly said by the
bar, that, in regard to this process,
the law makes no distinction between
a criminal and civil case- The same
return is required in both. If the sanc-
tion of the Court could be necessary
for the establishment of this position,
it has (been silently given.
McCullohvs. the State of Mary-
land.j: was a qui tarn action, brought
to recover a penalty, and the record,
was authenticated by the seal of the
Court And the signature of the Clerk,
without .hat of a Judge. Brown et
al .vs. the State of Maryland, was an
indictment for a fine and forfeiture.—
The record in this case, too, was au-
thenticated by the seal of the Court
and the certificate of the Cleik. The
practice is both ways.
The record, then, according to the
Judiciary act, and the rule and prac-
tice of the Court, is regularly before
The more important inquiry is,
does it exhibit a case cognizable by
this tribunal?
The indictment charges the plain-
tiff in error and others, being white
persons, with the offence of “residing
within the limits of the Cherokee na-
tion without a licence,” and “without
having taken the oath to support and
defend the Constitution and laws of
the State of Georgia.”
The defendant in the State Court
appeared in proper person, and fi!ed
the following plea:
“And the said SafnUel A. Worces-
ter, in his own proper person, comes
and says, that this court ought not to
take further cognizance of the action
and prosecution aforesaid, because,

for this purpose, is the lesidence

ment: and this defendant further
saith, that this prosecution the Stgte
of Ga. ought not to have or main-
tain, because, he saith, that’ several
treaties, from time to (ime, beemen-
tered into between the United States
and the Cherokee nation cf Indians,
to wit:—At [Hopewell, on the 28th
day of November, 1785; at Holston,

-_____	day of TTb
all which treaties have-beeriduiy rat-'
ified by the Senate of tip United
States of America; and, ly which
treaties, the United States (of Amer-
ica, acknowledge the said jCberokee
Nation to be a Sovereign Nation, au-
thorized to govern themstlves, and
all, persons who have settled within
their territory, free from tzny right
of legislative interference bj the sev-
eral States composing M United
States of America, in re$rence to
acts done witbin their territory; and,
which treaties the whole o| the ter-
ritory now occupied by (Ire Chero-
kee Nation on the east of the Missis-
sippi, has been solemnly guarantied to
them; all of which treaties are exist-
ing*treaties at this day, and in full
force. Bv these treaties, and par-
ticularly by the treaties of Hopewell
said Coi
of America, as-above recitedalso,
that the said laws of Georgia are un-
constitutional, and void, because they
interfere wit a, and attempt to regu-
Lde and control the intercourse with
the said Cherokee Nation, which, by
the said Constitution, beloig exclu-
Styles; and because the said laws ate
repugnant to the Statute of the Uni-
te^ States, passed on the -------ffay
of March, 1802, entitled, “an act to
regulate trade and intercomse with
tlje I nd ilin tribes, and to preserve
peace on the frontiers: and that,
therefore, this court has no jurisdic-
tion to cause’this defendant to make
further or other answer the said bill of
jndictment, or further to try and pun-
fish this defendant for the said offence
This plea was overruled by the
Court. And the prisoner being ar-
raigned, pleaded not gu'lly. Tin
jury found a verdict against him, anil
the Court sentenced him to hard la-
bor in the peniten.iary, for the term
offom years.
By overruling tlfis plea, the court
decided that the matter it cont a i, e
was not a bar to the motion, J’be
plea, therefore, c ost be examined for
the purpose of determining whether
it makes a case which brings the
party within the provisions of the 25i f
judicial courts of the United States.”
The plea avers that residence
charged in the indictment, was under
the authority ol the President of the
U.S. an.l with the permis si on and

diction of the several States com-
posing the Union of the United States;
and it is 'hereby especially stipulat-
ed, that the citizens- of the United
States shall not enter the said terri-
tory, even on a visit, without a pass-
port from the ‘Governor cf a State,
or from some one duly authorized
theretoIry the President of the Uni-
ted States; all which will more fully
and at large appear, by reference to
the aforesaid treaties And this de-
fendant "saith, that the several acts
charged in the bill of indictment,
were omitted to be done, if at all,
'within the said territory so recogniz-
ed as belonging to the said Nation,
and so, as aforesaid, held by them,
under the guaranty of the United
States: that, for those acts, the. de-
fendant is not amenable to the laws

validity .of the treaties made by the
United Stales with the Cherokee In-
dians. If not so, (heir construction is
certainly drawn in question; and the
decision has been, if net against their
validity — “against the right, privi-
lege, or exemption, specially sei up
and claimed under them.” They
also draw into question the validity of
a Statute of the State of Georgia,,
on the ground of its being repugn; t
to the Constitution, treaties, and
laws of the United States, and the de-
controversy, that the act tfCorgiess,

the United States and the Cherokees,
acknowledged their right as a sove-
reign nation to govern themselves apd
all persons who have settled within
their territory, free from any right of
legislative interference by the several
States composing the United States
of America. That the act under
which (he prosecution was instituted,
is repugnant to the said treaties, and
is, therefore, unconstitutional and
void. That the said act is, also, un-
constitutional; because it interferes
with, and attempts Io regulate and
control, the intercourse .with the
Cherokee nation, which belongs, ex-
clusively, to Congress; and, because,
also, it is repugnant to the statute of
the United States, entitled “An act
to - regulate trade aid intercourse
with the Indian tribes, and to pic-
compared with the 25th section of
to extend the. law's of Georgia over

the act on which- this indictmentvs.

persons from residing wjthin that part
of the chartered limits of Georgia.,
occupied by the Cberpkee Indians,

tection of the gold minds, and to en-
force the laws of the State within
the aforesaid territory,” are repug-
nant to the aforesaid treaties, which,, tution, or of a statute of, or
according to the Constitution of the
United States, composea^part of the
Supreme law of the laiA; and
