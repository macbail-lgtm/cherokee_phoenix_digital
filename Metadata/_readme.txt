Metadata Summary:

I wrote down the filename, unique ID, page number, language, color scheme, description, date, visible features, and content summary for each page of the Cherokee Phoenix from March 31, 1832.  I chose these fields because they show both the material and the text on the page, showing what it looks like and what it says.  This balance helps future researchers figure out how the condition of the physical newspaper relates to its historical meaning.  The same color scheme (black text on yellowed, aged paper) shows how all four pages were made and kept.
